* Nested tic tac toe
* Tied games are counted as no-win and count as blanks in the next level up
* Whoever goes first picks the super-square they go to  
* Then they pick the sub-square
* That subsquare sends the next player to the corresponding square on the super-square
* If that square is already filled, that player can then pick the square they play
